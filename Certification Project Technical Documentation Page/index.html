            <p>Python is a popular programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. It is used in web development, data science, automation, artificial intelligence, and many more areas.</p>
            <p>Python's easy-to-understand syntax makes it a great language for both beginners and experienced programmers. Unlike many other programming languages, Python emphasizes code readability.</p>
            <p>This guide will take you through some of the fundamentals of Python programming, covering variables, basic syntax, and more advanced topics.</p>

            <header>What you should already know</header>
            <p>Before diving into Python, it's helpful to have a basic understanding of programming concepts such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Basic control flow (e.g., loops, conditionals)</li>
                <li>Data types (e.g., integers, strings, lists)</li>
                <li>Basic operations (e.g., arithmetic, comparisons)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>However, Python is designed to be easy to learn for complete beginners as well. The simple syntax makes it accessible to users without prior programming knowledge.</p>
            <p>Having knowledge of other languages like JavaScript, C++, or Java is not required, but it helps when transitioning to Python because you will already understand programming principles.</p>

            <p>Python is often compared to other programming languages such as Java, C++, and JavaScript. However, Python emphasizes readability and simplicity, with less strict syntax rules.</p>
            <p>For instance, in Python, indentation is used to define blocks of code instead of curly braces <code>{}</code>. This makes the code cleaner and more structured.</p>
            <p>Python supports dynamic typing, meaning you don't need to declare variable types explicitly. Python will infer the type based on the value assigned to the variable.</p>
            <p>Unlike Java, Python code typically requires fewer lines to achieve the same functionality due to its concise syntax. Python's flexibility allows for rapid prototyping and easy code modifications.</p>

        <section id="Hello_world" class="main-section">
            <header>Hello World</header>
            <p>The first program most beginners write is the "Hello World" program. In Python, you can write this in just one line:</p>
            <code>print("Hello, World!")</code>
            <p>Here, <code>print()</code> is a built-in function in Python that outputs text to the console. It's one of the simplest and most widely used functions in Python.</p>
            <p>Python's print function can also be used to display multiple values, variables, or even the result of expressions. For example:</p>
            <code>print("The result is:", 5 + 3)</code>
            <p>This will output: <code>The result is: 8</code>.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="Variables" class="main-section">
            <header>Variables</header>
            <p>Variables are used to store data in Python. You don't need to declare the data type of a variable; Python automatically infers it:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>x = 10</code> (integer)</li>
                <li><code>name = "Alice"</code> (string)</li>
                <li><code>price = 19.99</code> (float)</li>
                <li><code>is_active = True</code> (boolean)</li>
                <li><code>items = [1, 2, 3]</code> (list)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Variables in Python are dynamically typed, which means their type can change at runtime. For example:</p>
            <code>x = 5</code><br>
            <code>x = "Now I'm a string"</code>
            <p>In the example above, <code>x</code> changes from an integer to a string during execution. Python does not restrict this, providing great flexibility.</p>
